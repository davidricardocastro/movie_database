            Jamie Foxx Still Claiming Martin Scorsese Will Direct A Mike Tyson Biopic
        </h2>

        <p>
            While Martin Scorsese always seems to have a busy schedule, it might have opened up slightly given the recent revelation
            that he bailed on that Frank Sinatra biopic. The director’s next picture is expected to be the hitman tale “The
            Irishman,” which will reteam him with his longtime friend Robert De Niro, but according to Jamie Foxx, Scorsese
            is still going to make a Mike Tyson biopic.
